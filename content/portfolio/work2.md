**Abstract** 

The global water crisis affects approximately 758 million people worldwide (Lifewater, 2021). one in ten people lack access to clean water worldwide. Two main factors drive water scarcity, climate, and water demand (EEA, 2020). To create an impact on the demand factor, four counties in the Metropolitan Atlanta area deployed a new project that provides free rainwater barrels to families who request them to store water and use it for non-potable purposes. An RCT was conducted to evaluate the average treatment effect (ATE) of rain barrel use in the reducing water bills of Georgian residents. This RCT analyzed the program's impact in reducing the water bills of residents. Two groups were created, a control group (520 households) with households without a barrel to store rainwater and a treatment group (777 households) of households using water from rain barrels to water gardens and lawns. Participants were followed by one year. There was no loss to follow up. The estimated household water bill for those with or without rainwater barrels was the intercept $220.9. However, the ATE for using rainwater barrels caused an average monthly reduction in water bills of $37. The average annual saving per household was $444. In addition to the environmental benefit the program brings in water preservation, we concluded that it also results in financial savings for households in the Atlanta Metropolitan Area. This evaluation will inform local authorities and residents of the program's economic benefits and provide a rationale for program scalability and expansion to other counties in the State.
