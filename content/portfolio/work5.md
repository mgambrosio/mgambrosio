**Abstract** 

 Many studies have demonstrated that smoking is directly associated with the risk of cardiovascular disease.This study hypothesized that the risk of earlier onset of CHD increases with the number of cigarettes smoked by an individual and the smoking start age. A sample size calculation was performed using R to determine the number of subjects required for this study. The calculation was based on the primary outcome age of CHD onset. A total of 30 subjects were required for a detectable effect size of 4.03 for desired power of 99% with two-tailed P<0.05. The study population was a sample of 268 subjects (approximately 55% male and 44% female, mean age of 40.25) of the Framingham Heart Study. Retrospective data were collected on smoking status, relevant CHD risk factors, and incident CHD events across four groups, non-smokers, light smokers (1-5), moderate smokers (6-15), and heavy smokers(16-25). Propensity score matching was used to create balanced groups. One-Way ANOVA test and Pearson's Chi-squared test were used to elicit the differences in smoking start age and gender among groups. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to examine the risk of CHD onset based on predicting factors. The study revealed that the number of cigarettes smoked significantly increased the risk for an earlier CHD onset by 6.94 years for light smokers(95% CI 3.9 to 9.9 p< 0.0001), 6.76 for moderate smokers (95% CI 3.6 to 9.8 p< 0.0001), and 6.47 for heavy smokers (95% CI 3.6 to 9.2 p< 0.0001). The smoking start age was also associated with an increased risk for earlier onset of CHD (95% CI 0.64 to 0.90 p< 0.0001).  This is an essential finding that demonstrates even more the importance of smoking cessation programs.
