Dr. Maria Ambrosio has great expertise in epidemiologic research methods to conceptualize and develop public health interventions to improve women and child health in developing countries. In 2017, she received her Medical Degree from Belgorod State University, Russia. Dr. Ambrosio practiced in private and public structures, and after experiencing the discrepancies between the policies and the practical reality, she decided to pursue studies in public health at Georgia State University, Atlanta, USA. In 2020 she worked with the epidemiology team of the Georgia Department of Public Health and used her knowledge and expertise to support the American government in response to the COVID-19 crisis. 

Dr. Ambrosio has been working on public health research projects since her earlier years as a medical student. In 2014 she cooperated with the Municipal Hospital of Soyo located in Angola, Africa and the local government to conduct a cross-sectional study to evaluate the nutritional status of children between the age range of 6 months and five years old. The main preposition of the endeavor was to inform the construction of a child nutrition center in the region. Throughout her career, She has involved herself in various community volunteering works through teaching and service. She is the co-founder of the Kuzola (Kikongo word that translated means "Love") Project, an initiative that for more than seven years assists traumatized children and adolescents of the government-funded orphanage Lar Kuzola in Angola, Africa. 

Dr. Ambrosio public health experience is not limited to research and includes several efforts to impact policy and inform evidence-based interventions to improve populations' health.
